/**
 * Data structure to store an undirected graph as a tree.
 * The indented usage is to add all nodes in their tree shape and then
 * remove certain relationships to form independent clusters that can each be
 * traversed.
 * <p>
 * The tree does not guarantee an integrity invariant while adding or
 * removing relationships. To verify a valid tree structure, call
 * {@link #verifyTreeIntegrity()}.
 * <p>
 * Memory space is O(n) where n is the capacity – the expected number of nodes –
 * and independent from the number of relationships added.<br>
 * To be more precise, two int arrays with {@code n} elements are allocated upfront.
 * Additions are O(1).<br>
 * Removals are O(1) is their best case and O(n) in their worst case
 * where n is the number of siblings on the level where the node is removed.
 * The average case is an amortized O(n/2) because removals require
 * a linear scan on all siblings <i>until</i> the target node is found.
 * A completely flat tree with only one level is the absolute worst case for
 * removals. Removing the very last node on such a tree is a O(n) operation
 * where n is the number of nodes inserted.
 * <p>
 * This tree is undirected, that is, the arguments to
 * {@link #addRelationship(int, int)} do not mean {@code source -> target}.
 * Though iteration uses the {@link RelationshipConsumer} as consumer interface,
 * it does not guarantee that the source and target ids always correspond to the
 * arguments to {@link #addRelationship(int, int)}.
 * For example, one might call {@code tree.addRelationship(1337, 42)} and later
 * receive a relation with {@code source}={@code 42} and {@code target}={@code 1337}.
 * <p>
 * Iteration in DFS consumes no additional memory, but is not stack safe.
 * Large or invalid trees may lead to StackOverflowExceptions.
 * BFS Iteration should always be save, but consumes additional memory to keep
 * a BitSet for visited nodes and the iteration queue.
 * Iteration is roughly in reverse insertion order, but this is an implementation
 * detail and not guaranteed.
