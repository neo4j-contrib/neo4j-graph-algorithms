/**
 * Helper methods for reading degrees of nodes.
 * This is in addition to {@link org.neo4j.internal.kernel.api.helpers.Nodes} with added
 * methods for counting undirected nodes.
 * <p>
 * Importing {@code undirected} is different from importing {@code both}:
 * {@code both} internally imports {@code outgoing} and {@code incoming} separately and nodes that loop
 * to themselves will be imported accordingly; relationships will be flattened into a single iteration during
 * iteration at query-time. In contrast, {@code undirected} merges all relationships on-the-fly and collapses
 * them into a single relationship storage during load-time. Nodes that loop to themselves will be
 * removed (de-duplicated) eventually, but have to be buffered during import first. We can only drop
 * consecutive loops, but this is not guaranteed to always be the case – loops can also be non-consecutive
 * and for those we need the upper bound during import buffering.
 * <p>
 * The existing methods
 * {@link org.neo4j.internal.kernel.api.helpers.Nodes#countAll(NodeCursor, CursorFactory)} and
 * {@link org.neo4j.internal.kernel.api.helpers.Nodes#countAll(NodeCursor, CursorFactory, int)}
 * return a degree count that, while being technically correct, does not cover the full buffer-size that we require.
