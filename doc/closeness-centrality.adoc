= Closeness Centrality

_Closeness Centrality_ of a node is a measure of centrality in a network, that measures the nearness (as opposite from the distance) from a node to all other nodes. 
Nodes having a high closeness score have the shortest distances to all other nodes.
Closeness centrality is based on the idea that nodes with short distance to other nodes can spread information very productively through the network.
This is important for the availability of knowledge and resources.


== History, Explanation

Sabidussi (1966) described the sum of the shortest path distances from one node to every other node as the node’s farness. 
Freeman (1979) used this idea to define closeness centrality of a node as the inverse of Sabidussi’s farness.
Closeness centrality is defined as the total number of relationships separating a node from all others along the shortest possible paths. 
In other words, to calculate closeness, one begins by calculating, for each pair of nodes in the network, the length of the shortest path from one to the other (geodesic distance). 
Then for each node, one sums up the total distance from the node to all other nodes.
The greater the *raw closeness centrality*, the greater the time it takes on average for information originating at random points in the network to arrive at the node.
Equally, one can interpret closeness as the potential ability of a node to reach all other nodes as quickly as possible.
Nodes having a high closeness centrality are nearby all other nodes and have advantages in accessing resources in a network or having a good overview of the agents in a network.

It is important to note that *raw closeness centrality* is an inverse measure of centrality in that it is nodes with smaller scores that are the most central.
On the other hand *normalized closeness centrality* is not an inverse measure, as nodes with higher centrality score are more central. 
Our algorithm returns *normalized closeness centrality* score.


== When to use it / use-cases

As an example, one can consider identifying the location within a city where to place a new public service, so that it is easily accessible for everyone. 
Similarly, identifying central people that have ideal social network location for the purpose of information dissemination or network influence. 
In such kind of applications, the nodes who can access the entire network faster need to be selected.

This measure is preferable to degree centrality, because it does not take into account only direct connections among nodes, but also indirect connections.
For closeness centrality in directed networks, we split the concept into in-closeness
and out-closeness. 
The in-closeness variable measures the extent to which a node is easily reached by others, as in there are short directed paths from others to the node. 
The out-closeness variable measures the extent to which a node can easily reach others, as in the paths going from the node to all others are relatively short. 
Closeness centrality makes sense whenever direct access is important, such as access to information, opinion formation, spread of disease and adoption of new technology. 

== Constraints / when not to use it

Unfortunately, when the graph is unconnected, closeness centrality appears to be useless because the distance between two vertices belonging to different components is infinite by convention, which makes the sum in 2 infinite too and therefore its inverse equal to zero. For every vertex of such a graph, there is always another vertex belonging to another component: indices of all vertices of the graph are therefore useless and the calculation of the index is limited to the largest component, omitting the roles played by individuals of other components.[1]

== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Can be also used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

== Implementation Details

:leveloffset: +1
// copied from: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/issues/99

_Closeness Centrality_ of a node is a measure of centrality in a network, calculated as the sum of the length of the shortest paths between the node and all other nodes in the graph. 
Thus the more central a node is, the closer it is to all other nodes.

== Details

- use `org.neo4j.graphalgo.impl.msbfs.MultiSourceBFS` for BFS
- MSBFS gives depth and number of sources.
- in this scheme the farness can be calculated as follows

 farness(v) = farness(v) + numberOfSources(v) * depth(v)
