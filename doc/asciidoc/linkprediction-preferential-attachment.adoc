== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Preferential attachment means that the more connected a node is, the more likely it is to receive new links.
This algorithm was popularised by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barab%C3%A1si%E2%80%93Albert_model[Albert-László Barabási and Réka Albert^] through their work on scale-free networks.
It is computed using the following formula:

where `N(u)` is the set of nodes adjacent to `u`.

A value of 0 indicates that two nodes are not close, while higher values indicate that nodes are closer.

The library contains a function to calculate closeness between two nodes.

== Preferential Attachment algorithm sample

.The following will create a sample graph:
[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/linkprediction-preferential-attachment.cypher[tag=create-sample-graph]
----

.The following will return the Preferential Attachment score for Michael and Karin:
[source, cypher]

// tag::function[]
.Results
[opts="header",cols="1"]

| `score`
| 6.0

// end::function[]


We can also compute the score of a pair of nodes based on a specific relationship type.

.The following will return the Preferential Attachment score for Michael and Karin based only on the `FRIENDS` relationship:

[[algorithms-linkprediction-preferential-attachment-syntax]]
== Syntax

.The following will run the algorithm and return the result:

RETURN algo.linkprediction.preferentialAttachment(node1:Node, node2:Node, {
    relationshipQuery: null,
    direction: "BOTH"
})
