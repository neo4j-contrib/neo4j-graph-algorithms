= The Eigenvector Centrality algorithm

[abstract]

This section describes the Eigenvector Centrality algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.

// tag::introduction[]
Eigenvector Centrality is an algorithm that measures the *transitive* influence or connectivity of nodes.

Relationships to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of a node than connections to low-scoring nodes.
A high score means that a node is connected to other nodes that have high scores.

[[algorithms-eigenvector-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]
Eigenvector Centrality was proposed by Phillip Bonacich, in his 1986 paper http://www.leonidzhukov.net/hse/2014/socialnetworks/papers/Bonacich-Centrality.pdf[Power and Centrality: A Family of Measures^].
It was the first of the centrality measures that considered the transitive importance of a node in a graph, rather than only considering its direct importance.

[[algorithms-eigenvector-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the Eigenvector Centrality algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
Eigenvector Centrality can be used in many of the <<algorithms-pagerank-usecase, same use cases as the PageRank algorithm>>.

[[algorithms-eigenvector-sample]]
== Eigenvector Centrality algorithm sample

This sample will explain the Eigenvector Centrality algorithm, using a simple graph:

As we might expect, the _Home_ page has the highest Eigenvector Centrality because it has incoming links from all other pages.
We can also see that it's not only the number of incoming links that is important, but also the importance of the pages behind those links.

By default, the scores returned by the Eigenvector Centrality are not normalized.
We can specify a normalization using the `normalization` parameter.
The algorithm supports the following options:

* `max` - divide all scores by the maximum score
* `l1norm` - normalize scores so that they sum up to 1
* `l2norm` - divide each score by the square root of the squared  sum of all scores

.The following will run the algorithm and stream results using `max` normalization:
