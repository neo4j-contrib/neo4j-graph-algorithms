= PageRank

// tag::introduction[]
PageRank is widely recognized as a way of detecting influential nodes in a graph.
It is different to other centrality algorithms because the influence of a node depends on the influence of its neighbours.

The underlying mathematics of PageRank is based on random walks on networks.
We can think of a random walk as the way that a person might manually traverse a graph.
We start from any node and then either follow one of its relationships to another node or jump to another node in the graph and continue our exploration.
The PageRank of a node is the probability that it is visited during this random walk.
More influential nodes will be visited more often.

// end::introduction[]

== History, Explanation

// tag::explanation[]
PageRank is named after Google co-founder Larry Page and is used to rank websites in Google's search results.
It counts the number and quality of links to a page to determine an estimate of how important a page is.
The underlying assumption is that more important pages are likely to receive more links from other pages.
// end::explanation[]

// tag::formula[]
PageRank is defined in the original Google paper as follows:

```
PR(A) = (1-d) + d (PR(T1)/C(T1) + ... + PR(Tn)/C(Tn))
```

where

* we assume that a page A has pages T1...Tn which point to it (i.e., are citations).
* d is a damping factor which can be set between 0 and 1. It is usually set to 0.85.
* `C(A)` is defined as the number of links going out of page A.

The PageRanks form a probability distribution over web pages, which means that the sum of all web pages' PageRanks will be one.
// end::formula[]

== When to use it / use-cases

// tag::use-case[]
PageRank can be applied across a wide range of domains.
These are some notable use cases:

* Personalized PageRank is used by Twitter to present users with recommendations of other accounts that they may wish to follow.
The algorithm is run over a graph containing shared interests and common connections.
Their approach is described in more detail in https://web.stanford.edu/~rezab/papers/wtf_overview.pdf[WTF: The Who to Follow Service at Twitter^].

* PageRank has been used to rank public spaces or streets to predict traffic flow and human movement in these areas.
The algorithm is run over a graph of intersections connected by roads and the PageRank score reflects the tendency of people to park, or end their journey, on each street.
This is described in more detail in https://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.1630.pdf[Self-organized Natural Roads for Predicting Traffic Flow: A Sensitivity Study^].

* PageRank can be used as part of an anomaly or fraud detection system in the healthcare and insurance industries.
It can help find doctors or providers that are behaving in an unusual manner and then feed the score into a machine learning algorithm.

There are many more use cases which you can read about in David Gleich's https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.5107.pdf[PageRank beyond the web^]
// end::use-case[]

== Constraints / when not to use it

// tag::constraint[]
There are some things to be aware of when using the Page Rank algorithm.

* Spider traps - if there are no links from within the group to outside the groups then the group of pages is a spider trap.

* Rank sink - this occurs when a network of pages form an infinite cycle.

* Dead-ends and Dangling links - Dead-ends occurs when pages have no out links.
If a page contains a link to another page which has no out links, the link would be known as a dangling link.

If you see unexpected results from running the algorithm it's worth doing some exploratory analysis of the graph to see if any of these problems are the cause.
You can read http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/courses/BIB/pagerank.htm[The Google Pagerank Algorithm and How It Works^] to learn more.

// tag::stream-sample-graph-explanation[]
As we might expect, the Home page has the highest PageRank because it has incoming links from all other pages.
We can also see that it's not only the number of incoming links that is important, but also the importance of the pages behind those links.
// end::stream-sample-graph-explanation[]

== Example Usage

We will run PageRank on Yelp's social network to find potential influencers.

In the link:#_import[import section] we stored the social network as a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirected_graph[undirected graph^].
Relationships in Neo4j always have a direction but in this domain the direction is irrelevant.
If `Person A` is a `FRIEND` with `Person B` we can say that `Person B` is also a `FRIEND` with `Person A`.

The default label and relationship-type selection syntax won't work for us here because it will project a directed social network.
Instead, we can project our undirected social network using *Cypher loading*.
We can also apply this approach to other algorithms that use *Cypher loading*.

== Huge graph projection
 
If our projected graph contains more than 2 billion nodes or relationships, we need to use huge graph projection, as the default label and relationship-type projection has a limitation of 2 billion nodes and 2 billion relationships.
Set `graph:'huge'` in the config.

== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe a subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Don't forget to set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

** Only with cypher projection

## Progress

- [x] single threaded implementation
- [x] tests
- [x] simple benchmark
- [x] implement procedure
- [x] benchmark on bigger graphs
- [x] parallelization
- [x] evaluation

## Requirements

- NodeIterator
- Incoming Relationships
- Outgoing Degrees

## Data structured involved

Our current approach needs one double array for storing ranks.

## ToDo

### parallelization

One approach to parallelize _PageRank_ might be to partition the node into batches - one for each thread. Nonetheless we may need to sync them at the end of each iteration.

### evaluation

- Performance tests on different dataset sizes / level of concurrency

## Future Improvements

- we might scale up the ranks to ints for faster multiplication.

== Details

Partition based parallel PageRank based on "An Efficient Partition-Based Parallel PageRank Algorithm" [1]-

- Each partition thread has its local array of only the nodes that it is responsible for,
not for all nodes. Combined, all partitions hold all page rank scores for every node once.
Instead of writing partition files and transferring them across the network
(as done in the paper since they were concerned with parallelising across multiple nodes),
we use integer arrays to write the results to.
The actual score is upscaled from a double to an integer by multiplying it with {@code 100_000}.

- To avoid contention by writing to a shared array, we partition the result array.
- During execution, the scores arrays are shaped like this:

    [ executing partition ] -> [ calculated partition ] -> [ local page rank scores ]

- Each single partition writes in a partitioned array, calculation the scores
 for every receiving partition. A single partition only sees:

    [ calculated partition ] -> [ local page rank scores ]

- The coordinating thread then builds the transpose of all written partitions from every partition:

    [ calculated partition ] -> [ executing partition ] -> [ local page rank scores ]

- This step does not happen in parallel, but does not involve extensive copying.
The local page rank scores needn't be copied, only the partitioning arrays.
All in all, {@code concurrency^2} array element reads and assignments have to
be performed.

- For the next iteration, every partition first updates its scores, in parallel.
A single partition now sees:

    [ executing partition ] -> [ local page rank scores ]

- That is, a list of all calculated scores for it self, grouped by the partition that
calculated these scores.
This means, most of the synchronization happens in parallel, too.

- Partitioning is not done by number of nodes but by the accumulated degree –
as described in "Fast Parallel PageRank: A Linear System Approach" [2].
Every partition should have about the same number of relationships to operate on.
- This is done to avoid having one partition with super nodes and instead have
all partitions run in approximately equal time.
Smaller partitions are merged down until we have at most {@code concurrency} partitions,
in order to batch partitions and keep the number of threads in use predictable/configurable.
