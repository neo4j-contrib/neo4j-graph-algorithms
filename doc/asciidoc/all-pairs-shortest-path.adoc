= All Pairs Shortest Path

// tag::introduction[]
_All Pairs Shortest Path_ (APSP) calculates the shortest (weighted) path between all pairs of nodes.
This algorithm has optimisations that make it quicker than calling the SSSP algorithm for every pair of nodes in the graph.

// end::introduction[]

== History, Explanation

// tag::explanation[]
Some pairs of nodes might not be reachable between each other, so no shortest path exist between these pairs of nodes.
In this scenario the algorithm will return `Infinity` value as a result between these pairs of nodes.
// end::explanation[]

Plain cypher does not support filtering `Infinity` values, so `algo.isFinite` function was added to help filter `Infinity` values from results.

== When to use it / use-cases

// tag::use-case[]

* The all pairs shortest path algorithm is used in urban service system problems related to the location of urban facilities or to the distribution or delivery of goods.
One example of this is determining the traffic load expected on different segments of a transportation grid.
You can read more in http://web.mit.edu/urban_or_book/www/book/[Urban Operations Research^].

* All pairs shortest path is used as part of the REWIRE data center design algorithm that finds a network with maximum bandwidth and minimal latency.
There are more details about this approach in https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/research/tr/2011/CS-2011-21.pdf[REWIRE: An Optimization-based Framework for Data Center Network Design^]

This query returned the top 10 pairs of nodes that are the furthest away from each other.
"F" and "E" seem to be quite distant from the others.

For now only single-source shortest path support loading the relationship as undirected, but we can use cypher loading to help us solve this.
Undirected graph can be represented as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirected_graph[Bidirected graph], that is a directed graph in which the reverse of every relationship is also a relationship.

We do not have to save this reversed relationship, we can project it using *cypher loading*.
Note that relationship query does not specify direction of the relationship.
This is applicable to all other algorithms, that use *cypher loading*.

== Huge graph projection
 
If our projected graph contains more than 2 billion nodes or relationships, we need to use huge graph projection, as the default label and relationship-type projection has a limitation of 2 billion nodes and 2 billion relationships.
Set `graph:'huge'` in the config.

== Implementations

`algo.allShortestPaths.stream`

- find shortest paths between all pairs of nodes
- returns a stream of source-target node to distance tuples for each pair of nodes
- writeback not supported
- if initialized with an non-existing weight-property it will treat the graph as unweighted

== Details

=== algo.allShortestPaths.stream

- returns a stream of source-target node to distance tuples for each pair of nodes
- Since all nodeId's have already been ordered by the idMapping we can use an integer
 instead of a queue which just count's up for each startNodeId as long as it is
 < nodeCount.
- Each thread tries to take one int from the counter at one time and starts its computation on it.
- The {@link AllShortestPaths#concurrency} value determines the count of workers that should be spawned.
- Due to the high memory footprint the result set would have we emit each result into
 a blocking queue. The result stream takes elements from the queue while the workers
 add elements to it.
- The result stream is limited by N^2. If the stream gets closed prematurely the workers get closed too.
- writeback not supported!
