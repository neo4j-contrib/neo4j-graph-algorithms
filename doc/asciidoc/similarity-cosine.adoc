// tag::introduction[]
link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity[Cosine similarity] is the cosine of the angle between two _n_-dimensional vectors in an _n_-dimensional space.
It is the dot product of the two vectors divided by the product of the two vectors' lengths (or magnitudes).

[[algorithms-similarity-cosine-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Cosine similarity is computed using the following formula:

image::cosine-similarity.png[role="middle"]

Values range between -1 and 1, where -1 is perfectly dissimilar and 1 is perfectly similar.

The library contains both procedures and functions to calculate similarity between sets of data.
The function is best used when calculating the similarity between small numbers of sets.
The procedures parallelize the computation and are therefore more appropriate for computing similarities on bigger datasets.

// end::explanation[]

[[algorithms-similarity-cosine-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the Cosine Similarity algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
We can use the Cosine Similarity algorithm to work out the similarity between two things.
We might then use the computed similarity as part of a recommendation query.
For example, to get movie recommendations based on the preferences of users who have given similar ratings to other movies that you've seen.
// end::use-case[]


[[algorithms-similarity-cosine-function-sample]]
== Cosine Similarity algorithm function sample

The Cosine Similarity function computes the similarity of two lists of numbers.

include::similarity.adoc[tag=weighted-function-note]

We can use it to compute the similarity of two hardcoded lists.

.The following will return the cosine similarity of two lists of numbers:

|===
| `similarity`
| 0.8638935626791596
|===
// end::function[]

// tag::function-explanation[]
These two lists of numbers have a Cosine similarity of 0.863.
We can see how this result is derived by breaking down the formula:

image::cosine-similarity2.png[role="middle"]

// This is the raw information for this image:
// [subs = none]
// \( similarity(A, B) = \frac{3 \cdot 10 + 8 \cdot 8 + 7 \cdot 6 + 5 \cdot 6 + 2 \cdot 4 + 9 \cdot 5}{\sqrt{3^2 + 8^2 + 7^2 + 5^2 + 2^2 + 9^2} \times \sqrt{10^2 + 8^2 + 6^2 + 6^2 + 4^2 + 5^2}} = \frac{219}{15.2315 \times 16.6433} = 0.8639 \)

// end::function-explanation[]

We can also use it to compute the similarity of nodes based on lists computed by a Cypher query.

// end::stream[]

Praveena and Karin have the most similar food tastes, with a score of 1.0, and there are also several other pairs of users with similar tastes.
The scores here are unusually high because our users haven't liked many of the same cuisines.
We also have 2 pairs of users who are not similar at all.
We'd probably want to filter those out, which we can do by passing in the `similarityCutoff` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of node pairs that have a similarity of at least 0.1, along with their cosine similarities:

// end::stream-similarity-cutoff[]

We can see that those users with no similarity have been filtered out.
If we're implementing a k-Nearest Neighbors type query we might instead want to find the most similar `k` users for a given user.
We can do that by passing in the `topK` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of users along with the most similar user to them (i.e. `k=1`):

These results will not be symmetrical.
For example, the person most similar to Zhen is Michael, but the person most similar to Michael is Arya.

// end::write-back[]

We then could write a query to find out what types of cuisine that other people similar to us might like.

[[algorithms-similarity-cosine-skipping-values]]
== Skipping values

By default the `skipValue` parameter is `algo.Nan()`.
The algorithm checks every value against the `skipValue` to determine whether that value should be considered as part of the similarity result.
For cases where no values should be skipped, skipping can be disabled by setting `skipValue` to `null`.
