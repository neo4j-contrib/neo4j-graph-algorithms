// tag::introduction[]
Euclidean distance measures the straight line distance between two points in n-dimensional space.

[[algorithms-similarity-euclidean-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Euclidean distance is computed using the following formula:

image::euclidean.png[role="middle"]

// This is the raw information for this image:
// [subs = none]
// \( similarity(p_1, p_2) = \sqrt{\sum_{i~\in~\textrm{item}} (s_{p_1} - s_{p_2})^2} \)

The library contains both procedures and functions to calculate similarity between sets of data.
The function is best used when calculating the similarity between small numbers of sets.
The procedures parallelize the computation and are therefore more appropriate for computing similarities on bigger datasets.

Euclidean similarity is only calculated over non-NULL dimensions.
When calling the function, we should provide lists that contain the overlapping items.
The procedures expect to receive the same length lists for all items, so we need to pad those lists with 0s where necessary.

// end::explanation[]

[[algorithms-similarity-euclidean-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the Euclidean Distance algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
We can use the Euclidean Distance algorithm to work out the similarity between two things.
We might then use the computed similarity as part of a recommendation query.
For example, to get movie recommendations based on the preferences of users who have given similar ratings to other movies that you’ve seen.

Arya and Karin have the most similar food preferences, with a euclidean distance of 7.68.
Lower scores are better here; a score of 0 would indicate that users have exactly the same preferences.

We might decide that we don't want to see users with a similarity above 17 returned in our results.
If so, we can filter those out by passing in the `similarityCutoff` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of node pairs that have a similarity of at most 17, along with their euclidean distance:

We can see that those users with a high score have been filtered out.
If we're implementing a k-Nearest Neighbors type query we might instead want to find the most similar `k` users for a given user.
We can do that by passing in the `topK` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of users along with the most similar user to them (i.e. `k=1`):

These results will not be symmetrical.
For example, the person most similar to Praveena is Zhen, but the person most similar to Zhen is Michael.
