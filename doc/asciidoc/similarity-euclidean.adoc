[[algorithms-similarity-euclidean-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Euclidean distance is computed using the following formula:

image::euclidean.png[role="middle"]

// This is the raw information for this image:
// [subs = none]
// \( similarity(p_1, p_2) = \sqrt{\sum_{i~\in~\textrm{item}} (s_{p_1} - s_{p_2})^2} \)

The library contains both procedures and functions to calculate similarity between sets of data.
The function is best used when calculating the similarity between small numbers of sets.
The procedures parallelize the computation and are therefore more appropriate for computing similarities on bigger datasets.

// end::explanation[]


[[algorithms-similarity-euclidean-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the Euclidean Distance algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
We can use the Euclidean Distance algorithm to work out the similarity between two things.
We might then use the computed similarity as part of a recommendation query.
For example, to get movie recommendations based on the preferences of users who have given similar ratings to other movies that you’ve seen.
// end::use-case[]


[[algorithms-similarity-euclidean-function-sample]]
== Euclidean Distance algorithm function sample

The Euclidean Distance function computes the similarity of two lists of numbers.

include::similarity.adoc[tag=weighted-function-note]

We can use it to compute the similarity of two hardcoded lists.

.The following will return the euclidean similarity of two lists of numbers:

// end::function[]

// tag::function-explanation[]
These two lists of numbers have a euclidean distance of 8.42.

// end::function-explanation[]

We can also use it to compute the similarity of nodes based on lists computed by a Cypher query.

| "Praveena" | "Arya"     | 8.0

|===
// end::stream[]

Zhen and Arya, and Zhen and Karin have the most similar food preferences, with a euclidean distance of 0.0.
Lower scores are better here; a score of 0 would indicate that users have exactly the same preferences.

We might decide that we don't want to see users with a similarity above 5 returned in our results.
If so, we can filter those out by passing in the `similarityCutoff` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of node pairs that have a similarity of at most 17, along with their euclidean distance:

| "Praveena" | "Michael" | 4.0
|===
// end::stream-similarity-cutoff[]

We can see that those users with a high score have been filtered out.
If we're implementing a k-Nearest Neighbors type query we might instead want to find the most similar `k` users for a given user.
We can do that by passing in the `topK` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of users along with the most similar user to them (i.e. `k=1`):

| "Zhen"     | "Arya"  | 0.0

|===
// end::stream-topk[]

These results will not be symmetrical.
For example, the person most similar to Michael is Zhen, but the person most similar to Zhen is Arya.

.The following will find the most similar user for each user, and store a relationship between those users:

We then could write a query to find out what types of cuisine that other people similar to us might like.

.The following will find the most similar user to Praveena, and return their favorite cuisines that Praveena doesn't (yet!) like:

== Specifying source and target ids

We could use this technique to compute the similarity of a subset of items to all other items.

[[algorithms-similarity-euclidean-skipping-values]]
== Skipping values

By default the `skipValue` parameter is `algo.Nan()`.
The algorithm checks every value against the `skipValue` to determine whether that value should be considered as part of the similarity result.
For cases where no values should be skipped, skipping can be disabled by setting `skipValue` to `null`.

.The following will create a sample graph:
