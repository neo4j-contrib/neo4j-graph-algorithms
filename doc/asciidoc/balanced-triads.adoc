[abstract]

This section describes the Balanced Triads algorithm in the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library.

// tag::introduction[]
Balanced Triads algorithm is used to evaluate structural balance of the graph.

It is based on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_theory[Balance Theory] proposed by Fritz Heider in 1958.
Unlike other algorithms where there are only positive relationships available, balance theory differentiates between positive and negative relationships.
Certain structures between individuals and objects are perceived as balanced whereas others are not.
In general balanced structures are preferred over imbalanced ones.

[[algorithms-balanced-triads-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Balanced triads is an algorithm that counts the number of balanced and unbalanced triads a node is member of.
It uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signed_graph[Signed graph] model to differentiate between positive and negative relationships using the sign of the weight.

Determining if the triad is balanced is simple math:

+ + + = Balanced
- + - = Balanced
- + + = Unbalanced
- - - = Unbalanced

== Use-cases - when to use the Balance Triads algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
* Balanced triads algorithm has been used to analyse structural balance of networks in the animal kingdom. Find this study in https://www.tau.ac.il/~geffene/PDFs/93-Anim_Behav_2013b.pdf[Structural balance in the social networks of a wild mammal].
* Balanced triads algorithm has been used to evaluate dynamics in the process of "healing" imbalanced triads and restoring structural balance in a social network. Find more details in https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~antal/Mypapers/friends05.pdf[Dynamics of social balance on networks].
* Balanced triads algorithm and balance theory allow us to better understand consumer to brand relationship and consumer behaviour as shown in the study of https://www2.bc.edu/arch-woodside/sep%2021heider%20balance%20theory.pdf[Updating Heider’s Balance Theory in Consumer Behaviour] by Woodside and Chabet.
