= The A* Algorithm

// tag::introduction[]

The A* (pronounced “A-star”) algorithm improves on the classic Dijkstra algorithm.
It  is  based  on  the  observation  that  some  searches  are informed, and  that  by  being informed we can make better choices over which paths to take through the graph.

// end::introduction[]

== History, Explanation

// tag::explanation[]

A* algorithm was first described in 1968 by Peter Hart, Nils Nilsson and Bertram Raphael[1]

In A* we split the path cost into two parts: g(n), which is the cost of the path from the starting point to some node n; and h(n), which represents the estimated  cost  of the path from the node n to the destination node, as computed by a heuristic (an intelligent guess).
The A* algorithm balances g(n) and h(n) as it iterates the graph, thereby ensuring that at each iteration it chooses the node with the lowest overall cost f(n) = g(n) + h(n).

In our implementation geospatial distance is used as heurestic.

== When to use it / use-cases

// tag::use-case[]

* A* algorithm can be used to find shortest paths between single pairs of locations where GPS coordinates are known.

== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Can be also used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

* [x] directed, weighted 

** direction: 'OUTGOING' or INCOMING, weightProperty: 'cost'

* [x] undirected, unweighted

** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: null

* [x] undirected, weighted 

** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: 'cost'
