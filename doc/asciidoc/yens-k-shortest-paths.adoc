[[algorithms-yens-k-shortest-path-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]
Algorithm was defined in 1971 by Jin Y. Yen in the research paper https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.17.11.712[Finding the K Shortest Loopless Paths in a Network].
Our implementation uses Dijkstra algorithm to find the shortest path and then proceeds to find k-1 deviations of the shortest paths.

[[algorithms-yens-k-shortest-path-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the Yen's K-shortest paths algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
* K-shortest paths algorithm has been used to optimize multiple object tracking by formalizing the motions of targets as flows along the relationships of the spatial graph.

* K-shortest paths algorithm is used to study alternative routing on road networks and to recommend top k-paths to the user.

* K-shortest paths algorithm has been used as part of https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/51e7/8aa2041d595b3871a49f4b92be725199e73d.pdf[Finding Diverse High-Quality Plans for Hypothesis Generation] process.

[[algorithms-yens-k-shortest-path-limitations]]
== Constraints - when not to use the Yen's K-shortest paths algorithm

// tag::constraint[]
Yen's K-Shortest paths algorithm does not support negative weights.
The algorithm assumes that adding a relationship to a path can never make a path shorter - an invariant that would be violated with negative weights.

== Graph type support

The Shortest Path algorithms support the following graph types:

* [x] directed, unweighted:
** direction: 'OUTGOING' or INCOMING, weightProperty: null
* [x] directed, weighted
** direction: 'OUTGOING' or INCOMING, weightProperty: 'cost'
* [x] undirected, unweighted
** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: null
* [x] undirected, weighted
** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: 'cost'

== Implementations

`algo.kShortestPaths`

* Specify start and end node, find the k-shortest path between them.
* If initialized with an non-existing weight-property, it will treat the graph as unweighted.
