// tag::introduction[]
Jaccard Similarity (coefficient), a term coined by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Jaccard[Paul Jaccard^], measures similarities between sets.
It is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of two sets.

[[algorithms-similarity-jaccard-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Jaccard similarity is computed using the following formula:

image::jaccard.png[role="middle"]

// This is the raw information for this image:
// ```
// J(A,B) = ∣A ∩ B∣ / ∣(A ∪ B)∣
//        = ∣A ∩ B∣ / ∣A∣ + ∣B∣ - ∣A ∩ B|
// ```

The library contains both procedures and functions to calculate similarity between sets of data.
The function is best used when calculating the similarity between small numbers of sets.
The procedures parallelize the computation, and are therefore more appropriate for computing similarities on bigger datasets.

// end::explanation[]

[[algorithms-similarity-jaccard-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the Jaccard Similarity algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
We can use the Jaccard Similarity algorithm to work out the similarity between two things.
We might then use the computed similarity as part of a recommendation query.
For example, you can use the Jaccard Similarity algorithm to show the products that were purchased by similar customers, in terms of previous products purchased.
// end::use-case[]


[[algorithms-similarity-jaccard-function-sample]]
== Jaccard Similarity algorithm function sample

The Jaccard similarity function computes the similarity of two lists of numbers.

We can use it to compute the similarity of two hardcoded lists.

.The following will return the Jaccard similarity of two lists of numbers:

----

// tag::function[]
.Results
[opts="header",cols="1"]
|===
| `similarity`
| 0.4
|===
// end::function[]

// tag::function-explanation[]
These two lists of numbers have a Jaccard similarity of 0.4.
We can see how this result is derived by breaking down the formula:

```
J(A,B) = ∣A ∩ B∣ / ∣A∣ + ∣B∣ - ∣A ∩ B|
J(A,B) = 2 / 3 + 4 - 2
       = 2 / 5
       = 0.4
```
// end::function-explanation[]

We can also use it to compute the similarity of nodes based on lists computed by a Cypher query.

// end::stream[]

Arya and Karin, and Zhen and Michael have the most similar food preferences, with two overlapping cuisines for a similarity of 0.66.
We also have 3 pairs of users who are not similar at all.
We'd probably want to filter those out, which we can do by passing in the `similarityCutoff` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of node pairs that have a similarity of at least 0.1, along with their intersection and Jaccard similarities:

| Michael  | Arya     | 1              | 0.2
|===
// end::stream-similarity-cutoff[]

We can see that those users with no similarity have been filtered out.
If we're implementing a k-Nearest Neighbors type query we might instead want to find the most similar `k` users for a given user.
We can do that by passing in the `topK` parameter.

.The following will return a stream of users along with the most similar user to them (i.e. `k=1`):

| Praveena | Zhen     | 0.33
| Zhen     | Michael  | 0.66
|===
// end::stream-topk[]

These results will not be symmetrical.
For example, the person most similar to Praveena is Zhen, but the person most similar to Zhen is actually Michael.

We then could write a query to find out what types of cuisine that other people similar to us might like.

[[algorithms-similarity-jaccard-source-target-ids]]
== Specifying source and target ids

include::similarity.adoc[tag=source-target-ids]

We might want to use this technique when comparing nodes with different labels that intersect on a common label.
In our sample dataset, recipes and people both have relationships to cuisines, which means we have a way of computing similarities between recipes and people.

.The following will find similarities between recipes and people, based on the cuisines that they have in common:

| Peri Peri Naan         | Arya     | 0.25
|===
// end::source-target-ids[]

The Peri Peri Naan and Praveena have a perfect score of 1.0 because they overlap via Portuguese and Indian cuisines.
Michael likes French, Indian, and Italian food, and two of the fusion recipes combine two of those cuisines, giving us a score of 0.66.

We could also use this technique to compute the similarity of a subset of items to all other items.

.The following will find the most similar person (i.e. `k=1`) to Arya and Praveena:
