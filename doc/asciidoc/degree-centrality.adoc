Degree centrality measures the number of incoming and outgoing relationships from a node.

The Degree Centrality algorithm can help us find popular nodes in a graph.

[[algorithms-degree-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]
Degree Centrality was proposed by Linton C. Freeman in his 1979 paper http://leonidzhukov.net/hse/2014/socialnetworks/papers/freeman79-centrality.pdf[Centrality in Social Networks Conceptual Clarification^].
While the Degree Centrality algorithm can be used to find the popularity of individual nodes, it is often used as part of a global analysis where we calculate the minimum degree, maximum degree, mean degree, and standard deviation across the whole graph.

[[algorithms-degree-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the Degree Centrality algorithm


// tag::use-case[]

* Degree centrality is an important component of any attempt to determine the most important people on a social network.
For example, in BrandWatch's https://www.brandwatch.com/blog/react-influential-men-and-women-2017/[most influential men and women on Twitter 2017^] the top 5 people in each category have over 40m followers each.

* Weighted degree centrality has been used to help separate fraudsters from legitimate users of an online auction.
The weighted centrality for fraudsters is significantly higher because they tend to collude with each other to artificially increase the price of items.

This sample will explain the Degree Centrality algorithm, using a simple graph:

We can see that Doug is the most popular user in our imaginary Twitter graph, with 5 followers - all other users follow him, but he doesn't follow anybody back.
In the real Twitter network celebrities have very high follower counts but tend to follow very few back people.
We could therefore consider Doug a celebrity!

[[algorithms-degree-weighted-sample]]
== Weighted Degree Centrality algorithm sample

This sample will explain the weighted Degree Centrality algorithm, using a simple graph:


.The following will create a sample graph:
[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/degree-centrality.cypher[tag=create-sample-weighted-graph]

This algorithm is a variant of the Degree Centrality algorithm, that measures the sum of the weights of incoming and outgoing relationships.

.The following will run the algorithm and stream results, showing which users have the most weighted followers:
[source,cypher]
----
include::scripts/degree-centrality.cypher[tag=stream-sample-weighted-graph-followers]
----

.The following will run the algorithm and store results, showing which users have the most weighted followers:
[source,cypher]

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1"]

| Name | `weightedFollowers`
| Doug    | 7.5
| Charles | 5.0
| Michael | 4.5
| Bridget | 2.0
| Alice   | 0.0
| Mark    | 0.0

// end::stream-sample-weighted-graph-followers-result[]

// tag::stream-sample-weighted-graph-explanation[]
Doug still remains our most popular user, but there isn't such a big gap to the next person.
Charles and Michael both only have one follower, but those relationships have a high relationship weight.

[[algorithms-degree-hgp]]
== Huge graph projection

include::huge-projection.adoc[tag=explanation]

.Set `graph:'huge'` in the config:

[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/degree-centrality.cypher[tag=huge-projection]
----


[[algorithms-degree-cp]]
== Cypher projection

include::projected-graph-model/cypher-projection.adoc[tag=explanation]

.Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config:

[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/degree-centrality.cypher[tag=cypher-loading]
----

Note that the `direction` config parameter is ignored when using a Cypher projection for Degree Centrality.
If we want to find the number of users that a user is following rather than their number of followers, we need to handle that in our Cypher query.

.The following will run the algorithm and store the results, calculating the number of users that a user follows:

.The following will run the algorithm and write back results:

CALL algo.degree(label:String, relationship:String,
    {write: true, writeProperty:'degree', concurrency:4})
YIELD nodes, loadMillis, computeMillis, writeMillis, write, writeProperty
