= Community detection: Strongly Connected Components

// tag::introduction[]
The _Strongly Connected Components_ (SCC) algorithm finds sets of connected nodes in a directed graph where each node is reachable in both directions from any other node in the same set.
It is often used early in a graph analysis process to help us get an idea of how our graph is structured.
// end::introduction[]

== History, Explanation

// tag::explanation[]
SCC is one of the earliest graph algorithms and the first linear-time algorithm was described by Tarjan in 1972.
Decomposing a directed graph into its strongly connected components is a classic application of the depth-first search algorithm.

== When to use it / use-cases

// tag::use-case[]

* In the analysis of powerful transnational corporations, SCC can be used to find the set of firms in which every member owns directly and/or indirectly shares in every other member.
Although it has benefits such as reducing transaction costs and increasing trust, this type of structure can weaken market competition.

* SCC can be used to compute the connectivity of different network configurations when measuring routing performance in multihop wireless networks.
Read more in https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=513803[Routing performance in the presence of unidirectional links in multihop wireless networks^]

* _SCC_ algorithms can be used as a first step in many graph algorithms that work only on strongly connected graph.
In social networks, a group of people are generally strongly connected (For example, students of a class or any other common place). 
Many people in these groups generally like some common pages or play common games. 
The SCC algorithms can be used to find such groups and suggest the commonly liked pages or games to the people in the group who have not yet liked commonly liked a page or played a game.

== Algorithm explanation on simple sample graph

image::strongly_connected_components.png[]

A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path between all pairs of vertices. 
This algorithm treats the graph as directed, which means that the direction of the relationship is important.
A strongly connected component only exists if there are relationships between nodes in both direction.

We have 3 strongly connected components in our sample graph.
The first and biggest component has members Alice, Bridget, and Michael, while the second component has Doug and Mark.
Charles ends up in his own component becuase there isn't an outgoing relationship from that node to any of the others.

== Huge graph projection
 
If our projected graph contains more than 2 billion nodes or relationships, we need to use huge graph projection, as the default label and relationship-type projection has a limitation of 2 billion nodes and 2 billion relationships.
Set `graph:'huge'` in the config.

== Cypher projection

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Can be also used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.
