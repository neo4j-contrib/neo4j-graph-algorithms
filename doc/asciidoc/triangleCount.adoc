// tag::introduction[]
Triangle counting is a community detection graph algorithm that is used to determine the number of triangles passing through each node in the graph.
A triangle is a set of three nodes, where each node has a relationship to all other nodes.

== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]

Triangle counting gained popularity in social network analysis, where it is used to detect communities and measure the cohesiveness of those communities.
It can also be used to determine the stability of a graph, and is often used as part of the computation of network indices, such as the clustering coefficient.

There are two types of clustering coefficient:

Local clustering coefficient::
 The local clustering coefficient of a node is the likelihood that its neighbours are also connected.
 The computation of this score involves triangle counting.

Global clustering coefficient::
 The global clustering coefficient is the normalized sum of those local clustering coefficients.

The transitivity coefficient of a graph is sometimes used, which is three times the number of triangles divided by the number of triples in the graph.

== Use-cases - when to use the Triangle Counting / Clustering Coefficient algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
* Triangle count and clustering coefficient have been shown to be useful as features for classifying a given website as spam, or non-spam, content.
  This is described in http://chato.cl/papers/becchetti_2007_approximate_count_triangles.pdf["Efficient Semi-streaming Algorithms for Local Triangle Counting in Massive Graphs"].
* Clustering coefficient has been used to investigate the community structure of Facebook's social graph, where they found dense neighbourhoods of users in an otherwise sparse global graph.
  Find this study in https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.4503.pdf["The Anatomy of the Facebook Social Graph"].
* Clustering coefficient has been proposed to help explore thematic structure of the web, and detect communities of pages with a common topic based on the reciprocal links between them.
  For more information, see http://www.pnas.org/content/99/9/5825[Curvature of co-links uncovers hidden thematic layers in the World Wide Web].

This means that everybody in the triangle knows each other.

[[algorithms-triangle-count-clustering-coefficient-example]]
== Example usage

In graph theory, a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_coefficient[clustering coefficient] is a measure of the degree to which nodes in a graph tend to cluster together.
Evidence suggests that in most real-world networks, and in particular social networks, nodes tend to create tightly knit groups characterised by a relatively high density of ties; this likelihood tends to be greater than the average probability of a tie randomly established between two nodes.

We check if this holds true for Yelp's social network of friends:

[source, cypher]
----
include::scripts/triangle-count.cypher[tag=triangle-write-yelp]
----

Average clustering coefficient is 0.0523, which is really low for a social network.
This indicates that groups of friends are not tightly knit together, but rather sparse.
We can assume that users are not on Yelp for finding and creating friends, like Facebook for example, but rather something else, like finding good restaurant recommendations.

Local triangle count and clustering coefficient of nodes can be used as features in finding influencers in social networks.

_algo.triangle.stream(..)_ returns a Stream of Triples with nodeIds for each triangle.

_algo.triangleCount(..)_ counts the number of triangles a node is member of and writes it back.
It also counts the triangle in the whole graph and returns it in the Stats

_algo.triangleCount.stream(..)_ counts number of triangles a node is member of and returns
a stream with nodeId and triangleCount

*Note*

*sum(triangleCount) == triangleCount * 3* because every triangle adds 1 to each of its 3 nodes.
