[[algorithms-single-source-shortest-path-context]]
== History and explanation

// tag::explanation[]
SSSP came into prominence at the same time as the shortest path algorithm and Dijkstra's algorithm can act as an implementation for both problems.

We implement a delta-stepping algorithm that has been https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.02113v1.pdf[shown to outperform Dijkstra's^].
// end::explanation[]


[[algorithms-single-source-shortest-path-usecase]]
== Use-cases - when to use the Single Source Shortest Path algorithm

// tag::use-case[]
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Shortest_Path_First[Open Shortest Path First^] is a routing protocol for IP networks.
  It uses Dijkstra's algorithm to help detect changes in topology, such as link failures, and https://routing-bits.com/2009/08/06/ospf-convergence/[come up with a new routing structure in seconds^].
// end::use-case[]


[[algorithms-single-source-shortest-path-limitations]]
== Constraints - when not to use the Single Source Shortest Path algorithm

// tag::constraint[]
Delta stepping does not support negative weights.
The algorithm assumes that adding a relationship to a path can never make a path shorter - an invariant that would be violated with negative weights.
// end::constraint[]

== Graph type support

The shortest path algorithms support the following graph types:

* [x] directed, unweighted:
** direction: 'OUTGOING' or INCOMING, weightProperty: null
* [x] directed, weighted
** direction: 'OUTGOING' or INCOMING, weightProperty: 'cost'
* [x] undirected, unweighted
** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: null
* [x] undirected, weighted
** direction: 'BOTH', weightProperty: 'cost'


[[algorithms-single-source-shortest-path-imp]]
== Implementations

`algo.shortestPath.deltaStepping`

* Specify start node, find the shortest paths to all other nodes.
* Parallel non-negative single source shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs.
* It can be tweaked using the delta-parameter which controls the grade of concurrency.
* If initialized with an non-existing weight-property, it will treat the graph as unweighted.

== Implementation details

:leveloffset: +1
// copied from: https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-graph-algorithms/issues/80

A Single Source Shortest Path algorithm calculates a path between a pair of nodes whose summed weights are minimal.
A common algorithm used is Dijkstra.
On the other hand, All Pairs Shortest Path calculates a shortest path forest containing all paths between the nodes in the graph.
An algorithm to solve this is Floyd Warshall or Parallel Johnson's algorithm.

## Progress

- [x] single threaded implementation
- [x] tests
- [x] simple benchmark
- [x] implement procedure
- [ ] benchmark on bigger graphs
- [ ] parallelization
- [ ] evaluation

## Requirements

`(Outgoing)RelationshipIterator` & `Weights`

## Data structured involved

- An int-based Fibonacci Heap which implements an efficient priority queue.
- Different Container for Costs / visited state / paths

## ToDo

### benchmark

Implement benchmark on big graph

### parallelization

Parallizing _All Pairs Shortest Path_ might be easy using Dijkstra on each thread for a different node. An easy approach for _Single Source SP_ may use two threads. One starting at the start-node, one at the end-node. The first wins. [More](https://www.cs.rice.edu/~vs3/comp422/lecture-notes/comp422-lec24-s08-v2.pdf)

### evaluation

- Performance tests on different dataset sizes / level of concurrency


== Details


=== algo.shortestPath.deltaStepping

TODO naming!?
- parallel non-negative single source shortest path algorithm for weighted graphs
- It can be tweaked using the delta-parameter which controls the grade of concurrency.
- returns minimum distance to *all other nodes*
- if initialized with an non-existing weight-property and a defaultWeight of 1.0 its result can be interpreted as
 the number of nodes to reach the target
