== Yelp Open Dataset

https://www.yelp.com/[Yelp.com] has been running https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge[Yelp Dataset challenge] for about five years now. 
It is a competition that encourages people to explore and research Yelp's open dataset, which contains almost 5 million reviews from over 1.1 million users on over 150,000 businesses from 12 metropolitan areas in the tenth round of the challenge. 
Over the years the dataset has become very popular with https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=citation%3A+Yelp+Dataset&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5[hundreds of academic paper] written about it.
It has well-structured and highly relational data and is therefore a great showcase for Neo4j and graph algorithms on a realistic dataset. 
We will show how to use graph algorithms on a social network of friends and how to create and analyse an inferred graph (for example, projecting a review co-occurence graph or similarity between users based on their reviews).

== Data

You can   https://www.yelp.com/dataset/download[get the dataset] by filling out their form.
Download the data in JSON format. 
We will use https://github.com/neo4j-contrib/neo4j-apoc-procedures/releases[APOC plugin] to help us with importing and batching data in Neo4j.
There are 6 JSON files available (https://www.yelp.com/dataset/documentation/json[detailed documentation]). 
Photos and checkins are not the topic of our analysis, so they will not be imported.
From the other files we will import a knowledge graph of Yelp's world, that contains data about:

 - 156639 businesses
 - 1005693 tips from users about businesses 
 - 4736897 reviews of businesses by users 
 - 9489337 users total 
 - 35444850 friend relationships
 
Depending on your setup import might take some time as _user.json_ contains data about a 10 million person social network of friends.
While _review.json_ is even bigger in size, it is mostly made up of text representing the actual review, so the import will be faster.
We also do not need the actual text, but only meta-data about them e.g. who wrote the review and how he rated a certain business, so the text will not be imported.   


== Graph Model

image::{img}/yelp_graph_model.png[]

Graph consist of nodes labeled User, that can have a FRIEND relationship with other users. Users also write reviews and tips about businesses. We store all the meta-data ( location of business etc.) as properties of nodes except for categories of the businesses, which are represented by separate nodes labeled Category.

Graph model always depends on the application we have in mind for it.
Our application is to analyse ( inferred ) networks with graph algorithms.
If we were to use our graph as a recommendation engine, we might construct a different graph model.

== Networks

=== Social network 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network[Social network] is a theoretical construct useful in the social sciences to study relationships between individuals, groups, organizations, or even entire societies. 
An axiom of the social network approach to understanding social interaction is that social phenomena should be primarily conceived and investigated through the properties of relationships between and within nodes, instead of the properties of these nodes themselves.
Precisely because many different types of relations, singular or in combination, form these network configurations, network analytics are useful to a broad range of research enterprises.


https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network_analysis[Social network analysis] is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory. 
It characterizes networked structures in terms of nodes (individual actors, people, or things within the network) and the ties, edges, or links (relationships or interactions) that connect them. 
Examples of social structures commonly visualized through social network analysis include social media networks, memes spread, friendship and acquaintance networks, collaboration graphs, kinship, disease transmission.

Social network analysis has emerged as a key technique in modern sociology. 
It has also gained a significant following in anthropology, biology, demography, communication studies, economics, geography, history, information science, organizational studies, political science, social psychology, development studies, sociolinguistics, and computer science.


Yelp's friendship network is an _undirected_ graph with _unweighted_ friend relationships between users.
There are 507948 users with no friends. They will be ignored in our analysis.

=== Projecting a review co-occurence graph

We can try to find which businesses are often reviewed by same users by inferring a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-occurrence_networks[co-occurence network] between them.
By way of definition, co-occurrence networks are the collective interconnection of nodes based on their paired presence within a specified domain. 
Our network is generated by connecting pairs of businesses using a set of criteria defining co-occurrence. 

The co-occurence criteria for this network is that any pair of businesses must have at least 5 common reviewers. 
We save the count of common reviewers as a property of the relationship that will be used as a weight in community detection analysis.
Inferred graph is _undirected_, as changing the direction of the relationships does not imply any semantic difference.
We will limit our network to those businesses, that have more than 10 reviews and project a co-occurent relationship between businesses.

== Projecting a review similarity graph

We can try to find similar groups of users by projecting a review similiarity network between them. 
The idea is to start with users that have  more than 10 reviews and find all pairs of users who have reviewed more than 10 common businesses. 
We do this to filter out users with not enough data.
We could do something similar to filter out users who have reviewed every business (probably bot or bored).
Once we find pairs of users we calculate their similarity of reviews using cosine similarity and only create a relationship if cosine similarity is greater than 0, sometimes also called hard similarity. 
We do this so we do not end up with complete graph, where every pair of users is connected.
Most community detection algorithms perform poorly in a complete graph.
Cosine similarity between pairs of users is saved as a property of relationship and can be used as a weight in graph algorithms.
Projected graph is modeled _undirected_ as the direction of the relationship have no semantic value.

Projecting a review similarity graph is often used in recommendations. We calculate who are similar users based on review ratings, so we can recommend to a user what similar users liked.
