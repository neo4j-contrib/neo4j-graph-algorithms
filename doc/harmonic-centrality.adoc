= Harmonic Centrality

== TODO

Closely related to Closeness Centrality. Should lead to the same distribution of values but
should also be resistant to disconnected graphs.

== When to use it / use-cases

Like closeness centrality but on disconnected graphs

== Constraints / when not to use it

?

== Algorithm explanation on simple sample graph



Disconnected-Graph:

 (A)<-->(B)<-->(C)  (D)<-->(E)

Calculation:

k = N-1 = 4

     A     B     C     D     E
 ---|-----------------------------
 A  | 0     1     2     -     -    // distance between each pair of nodes
 B  | 1     0     1     -     -    // or infinite if no path exists
 C  | 2     1     0     -     -
 D  | -     -     -     0     1
 E  | -     -     -     1     0
 ---|------------------------------
 A  | 0     1    1/2    0     0    // inverse
 B  | 1     0     1     0     0
 C  |1/2    1     0     0     0
 D  | 0     0     0     0     1
 E  | 0     0     0     1     0
 ---|------------------------------
sum |1.5    2    1.5    1     1
 ---|------------------------------
 *k |0.37  0.5  0.37  0.25  0.25
==================================

instead of calculating the farness we sum the inverse
of each cell and multiply by 1/(n-1)



== Example Usage

== Syntax

.Running algorithm and writing back results
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.harmonic(label:String, relationship:String,
{write:true, writeProperty:'centrality',graph:'heavy', concurrency:4}) 
YIELD nodes,loadMillis, computeMillis, writeMillis 
- calculates closeness centrality and potentially writes back
----

.Parameters
[opts="header",cols="1,1,1,1,4"]
|===
| name | type | default | optional | description
| label  | string | null | yes | label to load from the graph, if null load all nodes
| relationship | string | null | yes | relationship-type to load from the graph, if null load all nodes
| write | boolean | true | yes | if result should be written back as node property
| concurrency | int | available CPUs | yes | number of concurrent threads
| writeProperty | string | 'centrality' | yes | property name written back to
| graph | string | 'heavy' | yes | use 'heavy' when describing the subset of the graph with label and relationship-type parameter, 'cypher' for describing the subset with cypher node-statement and relationship-statement
|===

.Results
[opts="header",cols="1,1,6"]
|===
| name | type | description
| nodes | int | number of nodes considered
| loadMillis | int | milliseconds for loading data
| evalMillis | int | milliseconds for running the algorithm
| writeMillis | int | milliseconds for writing result data back


|===


.Running algorithm and streaming results
[source,cypher]
----
CALL algo.closeness.stream(label:String, relationship:String,{concurrency:4}) 
YIELD nodeId, centrality - yields centrality for each node
----

.Parameters

|===
| name | type | default | optional | description
| label  | string | null | yes | label to load from the graph, if null load all nodes
| relationship | string | null | yes | relationship-type to load from the graph, if null load all relationships
| concurrency | int | available CPUs | yes | number of concurrent threads
|===

.Results
[opts="headers"]
|===
| name | type | description
| node | long | node id
| centrality | float | closeness centrality weight 
|===

== Cypher loading

If label and relationship-type are not selective enough to describe your subgraph to run the algorithm on, you can use Cypher statements to load or project subsets of your graph.
Can be also used to run algorithms on a virtual graph.
Set `graph:'cypher'` in the config.

== Versions 

We support the following versions of the betweenness centrality algorithm:

* [*] directed, unweighted

* [ ] directed, weighted

* [*] undirected, unweighted

* [ ] undirected, weighted

== Implementation Details

...

== Details

- use `org.neo4j.graphalgo.impl.msbfs.MultiSourceBFS` for BFS
- MSBFS gives depth and number of sources.
- in this scheme the farness can be calculated as follows

 inverseFarness(v) = inverseFarness(v) + numberOfSources(v) * (1/depth(v))
