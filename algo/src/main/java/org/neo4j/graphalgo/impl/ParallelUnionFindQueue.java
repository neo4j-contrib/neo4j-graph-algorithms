/**
 * parallel UnionFind using ExecutorService only.
 * <p>
 * Algorithm based on the idea that DisjointSetStruct can be built using
 * just a partition of the nodes which then can be merged pairwise.
 * <p>
 * The implementation is based on a queue which acts as a buffer
 * for each computed DSS. As long as there are more elements on
 * the queue the algorithm takes two, merges them and adds its
 * result to the queue until only 1 element remains.
