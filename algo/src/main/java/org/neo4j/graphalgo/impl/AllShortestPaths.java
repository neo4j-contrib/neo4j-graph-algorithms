/**
 * AllShortestPaths:
 * <p>
 * multi-source parallel dijkstra algorithm for computing the shortest path between
 * each pair of nodes.
 * <p>
 * Since all nodeId's have already been ordered by the idMapping we can use an integer
 * instead of a queue which just count's up for each startNodeId as long as it is
 * < nodeCount. Each thread tries to take one int from the counter at one time and
 * starts its computation on it.
 * <p>
 * The {@link AllShortestPaths#concurrency} value determines the count of workers
 * that should be spawned.
 * <p>
 * Due to the high memory footprint the result set would have we emit each result into
 * a blocking queue. The result stream takes elements from the queue while the workers
 * add elements to it. The result stream is limited by N^2. If the stream gets closed
 * prematurely the workers get closed too.
