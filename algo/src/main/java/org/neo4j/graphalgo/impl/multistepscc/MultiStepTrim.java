/**
 * MultiStep SCC trimming algorithm. Removes trivial non-strongly connected
 * components. Its result is a set of nodes without trivial weakly connected nodes
 * as well as dangling nodes without relationships to others.
 * <p>
 * In simple mode only one iteration over all nodeIds is made. During the computation
 * all nodes with either zero incoming or outgoing connections are removed because such
 * nodes can never build a SCC.
 * <p>
 * Using complete mode the logic tries to reduce all nodes until no more changes can be
 * made. It also removes self referencing nodes (which build an SCC only with itself).
 * <p>
 * MultistepSCC basically uses simple-trimming but there may be circumstances where
 * complete trimming results in a better overall performance.
 * <p>
 * Since we cannot alter the Graph I decided to build the reduction using auxiliary degree-arrays.
 * Once initialized with all degrees I do update only it's in- and out- degrees to determine
 * if a node got decoupled in the previous iteration.
